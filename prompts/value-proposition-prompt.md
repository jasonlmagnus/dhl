# Golden Ticket Value Proposition & Messaging Tab ‚Äì Prompt Template (Source-Only Version)

## Purpose:
To present the official value proposition, approved sub-messages, and persona resonance mapping for the account ‚Äî exactly as stated in the provided documents.
This tab is designed for teams to copy and paste verified language directly into decks, proposals, and outreach copy.

## Prompt Template (Strict-Sourcing Version)

### Instruction:
Using only the approved account source materials ‚Äî specifically the Value Proposition Angles deck and the DMU/VP Workshop Summary ‚Äî extract and summarise the following without paraphrasing, inferring, or adding new messaging:

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Value Proposition Statement
- Copy the full, official value proposition headline and paragraph(s) exactly as written in the source deck.
- Do not reword or reinterpret the proposition.
- Attribute the text to its slide or section (e.g. "Magnus ‚Äì Value Proposition Angles AG Barr_V2, Slide 3").
- If multiple angles are presented, include only the approved or final route (V2) as confirmed in playback materials.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Supporting Sub-Messages / Proof Points
- Include only sub-messages explicitly titled or listed in the source file (e.g. "1. Space to expand today. Confidence it lasts tomorrow." and "2. Trusted to deliver.").
- Under each, copy the associated bullet points word-for-word.
- Do not include or create new sub-messages, themes, or inferred proof points.
- If sub-message copy is incomplete or not found, leave the section blank rather than rephrasing.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Persona Resonance Mapping
- Reference persona priorities only from the DMU/VP Workshop Summary or Value Proposition alignment slides.
- Summarise resonance by showing which sub-message addresses which persona priority ‚Äî but use existing phrasing (e.g. "Ensure production continuity" or "Deliver growth responsibly").
- Do not invent or infer new emotional benefits or messaging links.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Output Format (for Excel/Deck use)
