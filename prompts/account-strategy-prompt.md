# Account Strategy Prompt Template

## Instruction:
Using the uploaded account materials (Alignment Deck, CCC Intelligence Report, DMU/VP Workshop Summary, and Value Proposition files), extract and synthesise:

## 1️⃣ Long-term Ambition (Vision)

Describe DHL's long-term ambition for this account:

- What is DHL's ultimate goal (e.g. "win as a transformational, multi-product account")?
- What is the vision for the partnership (e.g. trusted growth and sustainability partner; full-service 3PL; future-ready logistics enabler)?
- How does this ambition align to the customer's strategic direction — such as brand expansion, ESG leadership, or digital transformation?
- What competitive shift or opportunity is DHL aiming to create (e.g. displace incumbent, reshape network model)?
- What value proposition and supporting proof points express the vision (e.g. "Growth at pace, without compromise"; "Trusted to deliver").

## 2️⃣ Short-term Ambition (Tactics)

Summarise the tactical focus for the next 3–6 months:

- What are the near-term objectives from the playback deck (e.g. site visits, stakeholder mapping, sustainability validation, proof-of-concept build)?
- Identify key success signals that will indicate progress (e.g. expanded senior engagement, clarity on project requirements, early credibility wins).
- Outline immediate Golden Ticket actions such as:
  - DMU mapping and persona creation
  - Value proposition validation
  - Proof-point packaging
  - Real estate and warehousing strategy articulation
- Include tactical language showing intent to build momentum, credibility, and trust ahead of formal procurement or incumbent renewal cycles.

## 3️⃣ Combined Narrative (Summary Paragraph)

Write a 3–5 sentence paragraph that fuses the long- and short-term ambitions:

"Our ambition is to become [Customer]'s long-term growth and sustainability partner — enabling expansion, resilience and trusted delivery through integrated, future-ready logistics.
In the short term, we will focus on [insert 2–3 tactical actions: e.g. building senior relationships, demonstrating warehousing and real estate capability, proving sustainability leadership].
Together, these steps position DHL as the natural successor to [incumbent] and the partner that helps [Customer] grow at pace, without compromise."
