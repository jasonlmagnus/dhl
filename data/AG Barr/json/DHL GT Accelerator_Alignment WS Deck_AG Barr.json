        "Lost/cancelled accounts: This document outlines DHL's 3 historic accounts with AG Barr (c.2020), of which 2 were lost to Eddie Stobart. Reasons for loss include scope changes and lack of appropriate infrastructure, suggesting perceived infrastructure capability gaps. In the post-COVID19 climate, the risk AG Barr aimed to mitigate with choosing ESL will be a lot lower, providing DHL with the opportunity to continue previous discussions and position themselves as a low-risk transformation partner.",
        "Pipeline: The documents outline the single AG Barr account in DHL's pipeline, with current actions taken by DHL and Magnus. It doesn’t outline how DHL can use this to inform their strategy other than a focus on warehouse and transport.",
        "New contacts: This  document outlines the inactive response from AG Barr towards DHL, with all 5 contacts unsubscribing from marketing emails and last contact in 05/2025. Strategically, this lacks information, but does outline DHL's need for lead generation within AG Barr."
